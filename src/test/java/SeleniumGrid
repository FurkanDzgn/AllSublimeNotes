SELENIUM GRID

AWS EC2 ( ) -->> computer and database servers
   * One server, another computer,
   * EC2 (Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud)
   * I am using the Ec2 machine means remote computer and doing paralel testing
   * DevOps create a Ec2 (virtual) machine

HUB it will be our main computer in Selenium Grid

NODE, it will be our connected computer with hub


        -->>     NODE

  HUB   -->>     NODE

        -->>     NODE


 ec2 -> sign in the console -> services -> ec2
 pcName -> Public DNS (IPv4)

 To be able to find the username and password for remote desktop:
  click connect -> take username:Administrator  and password:We need .pem file which we downloaded while creating the ec2 in aws website
------------------------------

1- We create the account in aws
2- We create one ec2 machine
     * 2016 windows t2.micro --> it is free
     * key pair (pem file) --> this one help us to generate the password for my ec2 machine
     * We download the microsoft remote desktop for ec2 machine connection.
     * We use the Public DNS (IPv4) for connection. We get the DNS from aws ec2 website
     * Username is Administrator and password generated with key pair pem file
     * We open the security for Internet Explorer (Server Manager)
     * We made local server + IE enhanced security configuration is off.
     * We download the chrome and java We open the firewall for inbound and outbound rules.
       We added new rules for the port and make all ports open to use
3- We downloaded the selenium grid from selenium website.
     * We need to navigate the location of jar file for grid
     * We need to first launch the hub using following command java -jar nameofthejarfile.jar -role hub
     * We need to launch the node and connect the node with hub using following command
       java -jar nameofthejarfile.jar -role node -hub urlofthehub

---------------------------------------------
Selenium Grid
 We need to download the jar file for selenium grid.
 We need to create the hub using selenium grid then we need to create the node and connect with hub.

  java -jar .\selenium-server-standalone-3.141.59.jar -role node -hub http://localhost:4444/grid/register/ -port 6666
  java -jar selenium-server-standalone-3.141.59.jar -role node -hub http://localhost:4444/grid/register -port 5555

  java -jar .\selenium-server-standalone-3.141.59.jar -role hub             //  http://localhost:4444/
  java -jar .\selenium-server-standalone-3.141.59.jar -role hub -port 7777  // http://localhost:7777/


  ctrl+C // exit your hub

  ctrl + C  // both cmd and tun the following commands in order
   1. powershell screen
    java -jar .\selenium-server-standalone-3.141.59.jar -role hub
   2. java -jar selenium-server-standalone-3.141.59.jar -role node -hub http://localhost:4444/grid/register -port 5555

   How many test cases u have?
   450 for Ui  -> 35 min in 4 different VM
   450 for Api -> 30 min in 2 different VM

   How we do paralel testing with Cucumber?
   Yes we did paralel testing I did't setUp
