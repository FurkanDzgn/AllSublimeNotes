 SQL (Structured Query Language)
 Database -> is collection of data which is stored as tables
 * SQL is command that is sent to database
 * Database store inside cloud which is a server.
 * That one language manipulate the database

Why companies need Database?
 1. Big data -> it is organized in format of tables
 2. Security ->
 3. Accessible from everywhere
 4. Easy to manipulate -> easy to reach and change easily

Two types of database:
 1. Relational Database -> Once tables are related to each other
     ORACLE SQL, MySQl, Mari DB...
     Small Applications
     Tables (format)

 2. Non-Relational Database -> tables don't have relationship/ table are independent from each other.
     Big Enterprise applications which is build with the help of Microservices.
     Mongo DB, Cosmos DB, Cassandra DB...
     Tables (format)
     Json (format)

Fake Data -> Mock Data

They don't give us real data, every environment has their data
Environment:
dev, qa, sit, e2e, stag, prod

Primary Key -> Uniquely identified rows, values has to be unique
Foreign Key -> can have duplicate values, and it is reference for other tables primary key

How do you prepare test data?

Who prepares test data?
  Developers might do it
  I am preparing the test data
  API POST call, go to ui and create


DBA -> Databse Administrators

Access to Database:
------------------
 qa environment access
 r  -> read access
 wr -> write access

How we can work/ commnicate database?

----

Download SQL -> Copy jdk path paste SQL -> create a connection manually

2. day

Write a query that will display first_name,salry,hire_date,job_id
for those employees who works in department id 50 and was hired after
1999.Sort the data by salary and employee_id

---------------

 API POST CALL
{
	first_name: "Arslan",
	last_name: "K",
	username: "ak",
	password: "12345"
}

It will create data in database

select first_name, last_name,username,passworf
from customers;

Arslan ->
K -> k

or you will test API GET call

GET -> https://qa.amazon.com/customers/ak

{
	first_name: "Arslan",
	last_name: "K",
	username: "ak",
	password: "12345"
}


There are two types of SQL functions, aggregate functions, and scalar(non-aggregate) functions. Aggregate functions operate on many records and produce a summary, works with GROUP BY whereas non-aggregate functions operate on each record independently.

Maven
we have artifactory it provides from dev ops team or companies requirements
All the dependencies from m2 file
* dependencies go to the mvnrepository an download and save in m2 file

- jar file is java files   / JAR = Jave ARchive file. it is Java equivalent of the zip file.

JDBC - stands for (Java Database connectivity)


every two weeks mock data delete/clean from devOps team

Dependency to read Microsoft Excel file -> Apache POI

JDBC Interview questions?
 1) What interface do you use to make connection with database?
   - Connection, Statement, ResultSet
 2) Who creates test data?
 My responsibility is create a test data?
