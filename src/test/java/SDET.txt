HTML ==>> HyperText Markup Language
          It is not coding Language, It is a Markup Language

Differences between Coding Language(Java,C++,....) and Markup Language
1- dynamic functionalities - in markup Language there is no method

Using HTML we can organize our document
text, links, header, title, picture, button,

Markup Language mark up english to another format.

Maven, Html

HTML Language is needs to be saved with .html extension

Using help of Chrome,Firefox and Safari we can see our html code with User friendly way.

-Single Page Application
Every page handled on the page.So, you do not need to refresh
everything just only related part will refreshed.

HomePage, About, Apply, Transaction, quick pay

Facebook

What is Web Apllication?

Web Application(Selenium),Desktop application,Mobile Application(Appium)
all web site    Chrome
                intellij...
                (Everything you see on the desktop
                 are all desktop applications)

(So everything that can be downloaded to computer is desktop, if you can access only thru Internet is Web Application)

Most Used Html Tags -->>
<html>
<head>
<body>
<h1>to<h6>for heading levels
<ol>.<ul><il>
<p>
<div>for bigger content sections
<img> for image .....
--

HTML + CSS + JavaScript = Front end developer( Angular JS)

Java + SpringBoot framework = backend developer

<br> is for break. Your tag or text be execution from next line on the page

<h1 align="center">Testing Tools</>
<h1> --> Tag
align --> align is Attribute
Testing Tools text is --> content text
<h1 align="center">Testing Tools</h1> --> Web Element. Selenium works with web element.

<a href="https://www.techtorialacademy.com/">Techtorial</a>
<a> --> Tag
href --> Attribute
Techtorial --> content text

NOTE: if the text is inside the tag and has the value it is called attribute

DOM --> Document Object Model

<table border="1">
     		<tbody>
     			<tr>
     				<td>Last Name</td>
     				<td>Sales</td>
     				<td>Country</td>
     				<td>Quarter</td>
     			</tr>
     			<tr>
     				<td>Smith</td>
     				<td>$16000</td>
     				<td>UK</td>
     				<td>Qtr3</td>
     			</tr>
     			<tr>
     				<td>Jhonson</td>
     				<td>$140000</td>
     				<td>England</td>
     				<td>Qtr2</td>
     			</tr>
     		</tbody>
     	</table>


Tbody is child of table
tr is child of tbody
td is child of tr

This two td is sibling
<td>Last Name</td>
<td>Sales</td>

This two tr is sibling

<tr>
     <td>Last Name</td>
     <td>Sales</td>
     <td>Country</td>
     <td>Quarter</td>
     		</tr>
     		<tr>
     <td>Smith</td>
     <td>$16000</td>
     <td>UK</td>
     <td>Qtr3</td>
     		</tr>

==Day2==

<html>
<head>
<title> --> this is related with the tab/window name
<br> --> to be able to display the next in next line
<div> --> division
<body> --> you can implement alot of  tags inside the body
<table> this is for creating table
<tbody> inside table we need to have tbody to provide the values
<tr> --> it is creating new row
<td> we are giving values directly to the table
<a href=""> --> To be able to  give the link and display them as link on UI.
<img src="locationOfImage(path of image or link)f"-->
<strong> --> makes your text bold
<ol> --> ordered list
<ul> --> unOrdered list
<li> --> providing elements using list
<select> --> In hyml select tag create drop down in boxes

<p><strong>Favorite Quetes<strong><p>

JavaScript + HTML + Css  => Angular JS Framework, React Framework --> for frontend development
Java+Rest = Sprint framework --> for backend development

TestNG framework and Cucumber

Right Click on the  chrome and select inspect to be able to open development Tool
Mac = optional+command+i
Windows = ctrl+alt+i


Element ->-> to find the web elements

SELENIUM

Selenium is a library to automate the web application.

They are different purpose not a different version

1- Selenium IDE
One of the firefox plugin where you can record your test executions and play them for next execution.
It has no a lot of functions like Selenium WebDriver.

2- Selenium RC(Remote Control)
You can use the coding to automate the web application with Selenium RC. You need to start/stop the server for your execution.

3- Selenium WebDriver
3.14.
Using code, we can automate the web application to test. We will be interacting with webelements
se we can control our website.

4- Selenium Grid
Selenium grid creates different node's to be able to achieve the parallel testing.

900 TC 6 server that's total executuion time will be 30 - 1hour


Tell me about yourself? Can you please tell about your profile picture?


Selenium WebDriver Pros
1- Selenium Webdriver supports multiple coding language.For example: phyton,java,ruby,c++....
2- It is free and open source tools
NOTE: open source --> everyone can see the code for this development, and everyone can contribute to improve.
Alpha versions are not that much reliable.
3- It has huge community
4- It can works with different browser for example: chrome,opera,firefox,ie

Selenium Cons/limitation/disadvantages
1- You can not compare or validate the picture
2- We can not handle the captcha
3- They don't have suppport team.
4- Learing curve is diffucult
5- It depends 3 party tools for reporting(Cucumber html, TestNG, Extends report)

Intellij, Chrome,

 Selenium Webdriver users:
Testers who want to save time on manually testing.
Developers have confidence in testing to know they aren't introducing regressions.

         Uses:
To test across multiple browsers and platforms.
A customizable and powerful framework.
Test script <-->WebDriver API <--> Browser.

Angular framework
React framework

1- Dowload the selenium jar file from seleniumhq website --> https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/
2- Dowload the chromedriver from --> https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=81.0.4044.69/
3- Add Jar file to your project
   *File
   *Project Structure
   *Module -->Dependency --> click plus button
   **Find your jar file and add it to your project
4- Go to your project structure and select  the Module->Dependency->Plus button --> find your jar file and add as a dependancy
5- Copy paste the chromedriver to your project
6- System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "locationOfchromedriver.exe");

Selenium Webdriver
- Selenium works with multiple browser (Chrome,Firefox, Ie, Opera)
- Selenium works with multiple languages (Ruby, Java, C++)
- Selenium works with multiple operation systme (Windows, Max, Linux)

get("url") --> navigates to website
getTitle(); --> gets the title of current page
getCurrentUrl; --> gets the url of current page
getPageSource() --> gets the html of current page



<h1 name="tech" id="techtorial1">Techtorial Academy</h1>
  <h1> is tag
  name id are attribute
  techtorial academy is text
  <h1 name="tech" id="techtorial1">Techtorial Academy</h1> --> webelement



Automation of the Page
1- Find the webElement
2- Find the unique locators
3- Store on the selenium project using findElement(locator); method
4- you can use the method from WebElement object


Task:
Find the locator for sign-on button
get the text of sign-on button.
if the text is equals to SIGN-ON print true else print false;


HOMEWORK:
Get the text for Register, Support and contact and validate them using java.
If it is passed print test is passed otherwise print failed.
